        <h1 class="title">Welcome to the ABOUT section!</h1>
        <p class="dodo">Hello, my name is Rui Ferreira and this is my website! I designed this because it is a project that I have to do to have a good mark at the end of the subject and to learn some new cool things!</p>
        <p class="dodo">I am a student at Emile Metz in Luxembourg and I had some time to design this website, it took me some time but in the end I managed to do it.</p>
        <p class="dodo">By doing this website I learn vary cool things and usefull information to use in the future. This is a very good and interesting subject but it's hard if you don't pay atention to what you are doing.</p>
        <p class="dodo">For example, for me to do this website I had classes with my teacher and I searched a lot to learn how to do this. Of course it may not look like what I wanted to do in the beggining but I am happy with the result. </p>
        <p class="dodo">I like doing this, creating websites it is fun but very tiring because you have a lot of information to pay atention. I could make this a hobby and who knows maybe I could design some websites in the future!</p>
        <p class="dodo">What mattered the most for me when I was doing this website was to have an idea of what I wanted to do and search as much as I could to make that happen, I am very perfectionist and if something isn't the way that I want I'll do everythin to have it the way I want.</p>
        <h2 class="title">I hope that you enjoyed my website! :)</h2>
